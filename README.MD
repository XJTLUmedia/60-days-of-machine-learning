# 60 Days of ML
This is the repository about code and data from @naina chaturvedi's 60 days of ML series.
Some codes are not working in python 3.11. I replaced some outdated code with newest code.
1. Some datas are not available after searching the original article, I found some of them on Kaggle
2. Some code can't run without original data. I modified some code by using similar looking data.
3. In some extreme case when both same data and similar data not available, I replace code in author's page with some similar examples on Kaggle. All of replaced code are called Other_code.ipynb
Hope all these code and data helps!!!
Enjoy.
